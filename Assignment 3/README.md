# Bungee Jump

## Purpose
The simulation uses Heun’s method to solve a differential equation for acceleration under gravity, with controllable wind drag and with an additional elastic restoring term B so as to simulate falling off the top of a 200 metres high tower with a 10 metre length bungee cord tied to your ankles. The task is to reach the ground (height < 1.0 metres) at low speed (<1.0 metres/sec) so you can safely slip off the bungee and walk away. Wind drag is adjustable from the keyboard ‘w’ increases it, ‘e’ decreases it.
