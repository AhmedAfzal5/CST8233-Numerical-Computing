# Building Motion Simulation

## Purpose
You are employed by an architecture company to write code for a building simulation. The
company has a client that wants to model the motion response of a tall building following being hit by a
sudden strong gust of wind. The simulation must run on a PC in real time and is part of a larger
simulation that includes the motion of traffic and pedestrians etc. Because it must run in real-time it is too
time consuming to use the more accurate but slow math library functions, so your task is to investigate a
less accurate but faster Maclaurin Series approximation. The motion of the building is damped so it
performs less than one complete oscillation. The following graph shows oscillation under differing
degrees of damping
