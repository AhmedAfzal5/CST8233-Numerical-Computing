# Building Motion Simulation

## Purpose
While the user wishes to continue, the user is asked to choose the number of terms in the series up to a maximum of five. Then the user selects a range of t, somewhere between 0 and +2.0 up to which the series is evaluated from 0 in ten equal increments. For each value of t the Maclaurin series approximation to the function is output together with the exact value calculated using the math library functions exp and cos. 

The error that results from using the series approximation is calculated in two different ways.
1. Exact % Error = 100*(exact value â€“ series value)/exact value
1. Truncation % Error = 100*first truncated term/series value.
