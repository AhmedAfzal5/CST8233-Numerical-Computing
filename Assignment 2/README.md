# Mooreâ€™s Law

## Purpose
Fit data using linear regression least squares method for an exponential function algorithm. You are fitting the data to the exponential growth law N = ae^b(t-1970) where N represents the transistor count and t represents the year and a and b are constants. The formulas in class notes are fits to the straight line equation y = mx + c so the exponential data has to be transformed to have this linear relation. With the transformed data, solve the least-squares linear regression formulas to get solutions for m and c and then convert them back to a and b. Then using the exponential formula with a and b, offer the user the option of interpolating/extrapolating the data to find what the transistor count and rate of increase will be in other years.
