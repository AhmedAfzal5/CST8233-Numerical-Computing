# CST8233 - Numerical Computing

## Description of Course
Learn the usefulness and power of numerical computing methods to perform a wide range of engineering andscientific tasks. Using C/C++ as the underlying programming languages, algorithms are studied and used to writeapplications that analyze and process real-world data. These include statistical data analysis, solving sets of linearand ordinary differential equations, interpolating and fitting data (including Fast Fourier Transforms), numericaldifferentiation and integration and simulating Real-World dynamics with Newton's Laws (as examples of differentialequations).
