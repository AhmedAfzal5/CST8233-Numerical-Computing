# Animation Project in C

## Purpose
You are to write the code in Visual Studio 2017 for a simple C language console application
that holds the data of an animation application (there is no actual animation graphics in the assignment)
using a linked list in dynamic memory. This will give you an opportunity to review material that has
already been taught in an earlier C course and get up to speed for programming that is used in this
course. In the lab you will be shown how to set up a Visual Studio 2017 project and what the application
looks like when it’s running.
The start of the code is shown on the next page; it is also on Brightspace in a text file that you can copy
and paste. Because I will use this code to mark the assignment you must not modify it (not a single
character changed): no code added or removed, no new global variables, no new functions, no macros,
no defines and no statics. Your task is to implement (after the main() function), using C, only the functions
that are declared at the top of the ass0.c file and not add any new ones. All your code is in the file ass0.c.
The Animation is a series of Frame objects held in a single linked list (forward list) in dynamic (heap)
memory. This memory model will be adapted to a C++ template in a later assignment.
When the application is running you can:
 add a new Frame to start of the Animation Frame list
 delete the last Frame in the list
 edit a selected Frame to change the frame name
 report the Animation to show the list of Frame details
 quit.
